[Negro Testies](https://www.urbandictionary.com/author.php?author=Negro%20Testies) define this at [urbandictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Let%27s%20Go%20Justin):
> Essentially the competitive video gaming equivalent of a curse. Any competitive gamer who has this spoken to them is doomed to a terrible fate at the hands of their opponent.
>
> Most notably seen at Evo 2004's SF3 tournament, where the infamous Daigo (as Ken) parried and punished all 17 hits of Justin's (as Chun-Li) super art with only a pixel of health left. Justin has genuine PTSD from the experience.
> 
> *Justin: \*has half health left whilst Daigo has only a pixel, has the option to wait out the clock\**
> 
> *Random whackjob in the crowd: **LET'S GO JUSTIN!***
> 
> *Justin: \*uses super art*\*
> 
> *Daigo: \*parries all of it and hits some insane combo, beating Justin\**
> 
> *Justin: :|*
